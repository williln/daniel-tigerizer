# daniel-tigerizer

The goal: An API, possibly with some sort of frontend, that categorizes all episodes of the hit children's show Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood and allows parents to see a list of episodes by category. 

## Contributing 

This repo is not accepting PRs at this time. It's public because why not? but it's a fun learning project for me. Or as Daniel Tiger and Katerina would sing, "If there's something you need, try to make it yourse-e-elf!"
